## effeffe - Filippo Falezza's personal website
### whoami
Hello, I'm a third year physics student at the University of Birmingham, UK.  
My main intrests are physics, electronics, hardware hacking, programming and Linux, among many others.

### declaration of intents
This website has the purpose of publishing some of the projects I do, together with random stuff I come across daily, which is not usually available as a blog and it would be pointless to make a specific one just for that.  
Enjoy :)
