## effeffe - Filippo Falezza's personal website
### whoami
Hello, I'm a second year physics student at the University of Birmingham, Uk.
My main intrests are physics, electronics, hardware hacking, programming and Linux, but many others often come across.

### declaration of intents
This website has as purpose to publish some of the projects I do, together with random stuff I come across daily, which is not usually available as a blog and it would be useless to make a specific one just for that.
Enjoy :)
