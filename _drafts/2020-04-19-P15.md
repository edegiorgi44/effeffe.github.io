# MSI P15 A10SC
So, I got this new laptop a couple of weeks ago, and I obviousely installed linux. My choice was for ArchLinux, but since I didn't have enough time to install it first, I got Manjaro. Later on, I tought to reinstall it, but I optimised too much to do it, so I skipped. Maybe I will do it after this post :)  

#Heating
Immediately installing linux on this very powerful machine, I noticed it was kind ov overheating. Maybe, this is the major problem of this laptop, as you'll see later on.  
The github user YoYPa [1](https://github.com/YoyPa) made isw [2](https://github.com/YoyPa/isw), a python script that manages the EC (Embedded Controller) ad the MSI Creator Center would do. In particular, you can manage the fan speed profile for the gpu/cpu, view the current fan speed, enable/disable the cooler boost and other things that I personally didn't investigate, such as the battery charge limit (I set this in windows and the settings was not discarded starting linux, but I set it just to be sure).  
In particular, the P15 A10SC configuration should be `16S3EMS1`, easily verifiable by an EC dump via
```sudo isw -c```
at the addresses 0x0a to 0x07.  

Considering how the cooling system has been designed, visible in [3](https://www.msi.com/Content-Creation/Prestige-15-A10X) and [4](https://www.notebookcheck.net/MSI-Prestige-15-A10SC-Laptop-Review-One-of-the-Best-Dell-XPS-15-Alternatives.441280.0.html#Emissions), I believe the GPU fan should never go completely off
