# Nasa SpaceApps Challenge 2020 - Connect Two
This is just a short post to show what my team has been working on in early October. In those days, we participated in the Nasa Space Apps Challenge for the "Let's Connect" category. 
We were required to ideate an innovative docking system for space modules. The entire idea has been described and reported in [1], and a short animation on how it is supposed to work is showed in [2]. As this system is supposed to dock two different modules, it has been named "Connect Two". This system is based on quick-release compressor pipes, which revealed very effective for air-tight applications were bolts and nuts want to be avoided.

Although we didn't win, our team "It works on my machine" got to the global nominations [3].
